# ccalc  

Command line math expression evaluator - from the original by Steve Hanov: [http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=26](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/?id=26)  
The source code that I started with was available on 20 June 2019 at: [http://stevehanov.ca/blog/calc.c](http://stevehanov.ca/blog/calc.c)   
This is a simple command line calculator to save you the clicks or keystrokes required by many common options.  

For example;  

```F:\>ccalc 100/(412117/78221)  
18.980290  
```
